\item{input}{input a character vector consisting of the full path name to 16-bit raw tif image files.}

\item{coordinate}{matching coordinates in the main plane to be registered to (in millimeters).}

\item{plane}{the main plane to register too: "coronal", "sagital", "".}

\description{
An image sensor of a camera is composed of a two dimensional array of light sensitive detectors or pixels. The sesnor array is #'mechanically quite stable with the pixels retaining a rigidly fixed geometric relationship. Each pixel within the array, however, #'has its own unique light sensitivity characteristics. As these characteristics affect camera performance, they must be removed #'through calibration. The process by which a camera is calibrated is known as "Flat Fielding" or "Shading Correction".
